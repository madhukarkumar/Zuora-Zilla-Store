This is a sample reference Zuora store to demonstrate use of Zuora APIs using PHP.
This sample store has the following use cases:
1. Display Products created in Zuora by Base Product and Add On Product.
2. Allow end user to sign up in a single step. The subscribe page accepts Account Info, Credit card in a PCI compliant Hosted Payment Page iFrame and creates a Billing Account in Zuora, creates a subscription, generates an invoice and collect payment with the credit card. This page also creates a corresponding Account object in Salesforce and populates Zuora Billing Account with the Salesforce Account Id.
3. This sample store then displays what the end user just bought and the other information related to the Account.
